# Amos' Keyboardio Model 01 Firmware

I started with the original firmware and am modifying it to fit my own
style and workflow. Thank you to the keyboard.io team for the start to
get going on my own firmware.

# Download and install
```sh
make flash
```

When the builder tells you to hit Enter to continue, hold down "Prog" in the top left corner of your keyboard and hit Enter.
